## Technology
I am going to teach myself [anime.js](https://animejs.com/)

## Rationale
For my app Planta, I want to add a level of animation to different buttons, and features to make it more fun and welcoming. I especially want to add animation in the tutorial section, so I can better illustrate out to use the app without static images.
